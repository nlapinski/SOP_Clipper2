Wrapper around clipper2 (https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2) for Houdini/HDK

Buils a OTL for all the basic functions. Many of the functions can be done with the boolean sop now, but clipper2 will handle open curves/lines. It also provides more stable curve buffering than the polyexpand2D in some cases.
